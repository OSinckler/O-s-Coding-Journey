Block Letters
ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.

Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

ASCII art of letters. For example, the ASCII art of the letter F is comprised of 5 characters in the first row, one character in the second and third rows, three characters in the fourth row, and one character in the fifth, sixth, and seventh row. These characters when viewed together look like the letter F

Happy coding!

Take a look at the complete alphabet and find your initials. Notice how each block letter is 7x5 and formed by the letter itself.

My initials are S and L, so my initials.py program should output:

 SSS   L
S   S  L
S      L
 SSS   L
    S  L
S   S  L
 SSS   LLLLL
